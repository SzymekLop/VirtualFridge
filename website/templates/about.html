                <br><br>Around the world, more than enough food is produced to feed the global populationâ€”but as many as 811 million people still go hungry.
                <br><br>One third of all the food that is produced for human consumption is wasted. When we waste food, we waste all the resources that go into producing and transporting the food, such as land, water and fuel use, without gaining any of the benefits of feeding people. When food ends up in landfill it also contributes to greenhouse gas emissions. Food waste remains a problem in Europe and around the world.
                <br><br>We must take action to stop this! This app will try to help you take responsibility and take care of our planet.
